# Overview of C++ programming(GAME
DEVELOPMENT:SNAKE GAME)
This program implements a simple **Snake Game** using the **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**. The game takes place in a grid-based environment, where the player controls a snake that grows longer each time it consumes food. The game starts with the snake positioned in the middle of the screen, moving in the right direction. The snake's movement is controlled via arrow keys, and the player must avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body to keep playing. Food appears randomly on the grid, and consuming it increases the player's score and the snake's length. The program uses a `RenderWindow` to display the game, where the snake and food are represented as rectangles of fixed size. A `Clock` manages the snake's speed and game progression. If the snake collides with a wall or itself, the game ends, displaying the final score in the console. The program is structured with clear methods for rendering graphics, detecting collisions, moving the snake, and spawning food, offering a smooth and responsive gameplay experience.
